===============================

Project Overview
----------------

**TaskFlow** is a robust and intuitive task management application built using React.js and Material-UI. It allows users to organize, track, and manage their tasks effectively with features such as a Kanban board, grid view, and list view. The application demonstrates advanced front-end capabilities, efficient state management, and a polished user interface.

Key Features
------------

*   **Three View Modes:** Users can switch between **list**, **grid**, and **Kanban board** to manage tasks as per their preference.
*   **CRUD Operations:** Add, edit, view, and delete tasks with seamless navigation and real-time updates using context-based state management.
*   **Drag-and-Drop:** Kanban board integrates a drag-and-drop feature for easy task reorganization, with automatic status updates.
*   **Real-time Data:** The application uses a JSON Server to simulate a backend, storing and retrieving task data dynamically.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout built with Material-UI to ensure compatibility across devices.

Technical Stack
---------------

*   **React.js:** Core framework for building the application.
*   **Material-UI:** For a modern and accessible design system.
*   **React Router:** Handles seamless navigation between views.
*   **JSON Server:** Simulates a backend for storing and managing tasks.
*   **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and better maintainability.
*   **Docker:** The project is containerized for consistent deployment.

Highlight Features
------------------

### Kanban Board

The Kanban board provides a visually rich task management system, where users can drag and drop tasks between "Pending," "In Progress," and "Completed" columns. Completed tasks display a soft green background to signify closure.

### List View

Displays tasks in a structured table format, combining titles and descriptions in one column. Statuses are displayed with color-coded badges, and actions such as view, edit, and delete are conveniently placed for quick interaction.

### Grid View

Provides a card-based layout for tasks, with actions accessible directly from each card. A subtle border and background highlight completed tasks.

Project Workflow
----------------

1.  The user starts by navigating to the homepage, where they can view their tasks in the default list view.
2.  They can add new tasks using the "Add Task" button, which opens a form to capture the task's title, description, and status.
3.  Tasks can be edited or deleted directly from the list, grid, or Kanban view.
4.  The drag-and-drop feature in the Kanban board updates the task's status seamlessly.
5.  All task data is persisted using a lightweight JSON Server backend.

Why TaskFlow?
-------------

TaskFlow is designed to showcase both technical and design skills. It demonstrates my ability to:

*   Build scalable React applications with advanced state management.
*   Integrate dynamic features such as drag-and-drop.
*   Create a polished, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
*   Utilize modern development practices with TypeScript and Docker.

The project highlights a deep understanding of front-end principles and provides a glimpse into my capability to deliver professional-grade software.
